= Cyrus Snaps
Example photo sharing app written using RubyMotion and Sinatra. This is the
RubyMotion half of the project.

== Features
=== Implemented
* View photos shared by users
* View a map of photos shared by users
* Upload a photo and share it

=== Ideas
* Comment on shared photos
* Login with Facebook

== Development Setup
Install dependencies using Bundler:
<tt>bundle install</tt>

In order to test the app in the simulator, you'll need the API project running.
Clone the API[https://github.com/cyrusinnovation/cyrus-snaps-api] project and
start the server using <tt>bundle exec rackup config.ru</tt>.

You will also need to set up an environment variable for the API URL. You can
export one like this:

    export BASE_URL=http://localhost:9292

or specify it in the rake task:

    rake BASE_URL=http://localhost:9292

Run the RubyMotion app as normal using <tt>rake</tt>.

== Tests
=== Unit Tests
Unit tests can be run as normal using:

    rake spec

Unit tests should not require the remote API to run. All requests are mocked.

=== Integration Tests
Integration tests are run using the
motion-frank[https://github.com/cyrusinnovation/motion-frank] gem.

    rake frank

These tests <em>do</em> require the API to be running (see development setup
above for how to run one locally). Unless you have exported the BASE_URL
environment variable you'll need to specify that when running the tests like
this:

    rake frank BASE_URL=http://localhost:9292

== Deploying
This is still a work in progress. The app has not been deployed yet, use the
iOS simulator to play around with it.

=== TestFlight
Deploying a build to TestFlight is done as normal using the
motion-testflight[https://github.com/HipByte/motion-testflight] gem.
TestFlight API tokens must be set as environment variables. Any easy way to do
that is to create a <tt>.env</tt> file that looks like this...

    export TESTFLIGHT_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
    export TESTFLIGHT_TEAM_TOKEN=<YOUR_TEAM_TOKEN>
    export TESTFLIGHT_APP_TOKEN=<YOUR_APP_TOKEN>

...and then source it in your terminal (you may wish to put BASE_URL in there
as well).

== Contributing
=== Issues / Roadmap
Use GitHub issues[https://github.com/cyrusinnovation/cyrus-snaps-ios/issues] for
reporting bug and feature requests.

=== Patches / Pull Requests
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or history
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
